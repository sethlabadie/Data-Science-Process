## Big data analytics life cycle

Authors Thomas Erl, Wajid Khattak, and Paul Buhler proposed a big data analytics life cycle in their book, Big Data Fundamentals: Concepts, Drivers & Techniques. Their life cycle suggests phases divided into nine steps:

Business case evaluation

Data identification

Data acquisition and filtering

Data extraction

Data validation and cleaning 

Data aggregation and representation

Data analysis

Data visualization

Utilization of analysis results

This life cycle appears to have three or four more steps than the previous life cycle models. But in reality, they have just broken down what we have been referring to as Prepare and Process into smaller steps. It emphasizes the individual tasks required for gathering, preparing, and cleaning data before the analysis phase.
