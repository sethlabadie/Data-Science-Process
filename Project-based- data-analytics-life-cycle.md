#Project-based data analytics life cycle 

A project-based data analytics life cycle has five simple steps:

Identifying the problem

Designing data requirements

Pre-processing data

Performing data analysis

Visualizing data

This data analytics project life cycle was developed by Vignesh Prajapati. It doesnâ€™t include the sixth phase, or what we have been referring to as the Act phase. However, it still covers a lot of the same steps as the life cycles we have already described. It begins with identifying the problem, preparing and processing data before analysis, and ends with data visualization.
