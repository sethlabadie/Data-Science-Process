Data Science Process

The first step is **asking a question**, where the aim is to discover what the scientific goal is, and what you are trying to predict or estimate.

Next is **determining the necessary data**, where we figure out what sample size is needed, and what data we actually need to prove or refute the initial hypothesis.

After this is **getting the data**, during which we discover things such as how the data was sampled, which of the data is relevant and whether there are privacy issues.

The next step is **cleaning and organizing the data**, where we determine if the data is readable, and also get rid of unnecessary values such as outliers.

Next, we **explore the data**, during which we plot the data, and check things such as where there are anomalies or patterns that might be important.

Next is **modeling the data** which includes building, fitting and then validating the accuracy of the model.

And last, but not least, is **communicating your findings**, where we share what we learned, determine if the results made sense and if we can tell a story from the data.
